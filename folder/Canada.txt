# Comprehensive Report: Market Entry Strategy for Heated Tobacco Devices in the US

## Introduction

Entering the US market as a seller of a heated tobacco device necessitates a deep understanding of a multifaceted regulatory landscape. This landscape encompasses federal and state regulations, FDA approval processes, tax legislation, age verification protocols, and marketing restrictions. This report provides a detailed overview of these elements and offers resources for further exploration.

## FDA Approval

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the primary regulatory body overseeing the sale of tobacco products, including heated tobacco devices. The FDA's Center for Tobacco Products implements the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which empowers the FDA to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products. 

Before a heated tobacco device can be sold in the US, it must receive FDA approval. The approval process involves rigorous testing and review to ensure the product meets safety and efficacy standards. For more information on the FDA approval process, visit the [FDA's website](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/rules-regulations-and-guidance/family-smoking-prevention-and-tobacco-control-act-overview).

## Tax Legislation

Tax legislation for tobacco products is a complex issue that varies significantly from state to state. The Tax Foundation provides a detailed map and table of the excise tax rates on cigarettes in each state as of 2020. While this information provides a general overview, the specific tax legislation for heated tobacco devices may differ and can be subject to change. For the most accurate information, it is recommended to consult with a tax expert or legal professional. For an overview of state excise tax rates, visit the [Tax Foundation's website](https://taxfoundation.org/state-cigarette-tax-rates-2020/).

## Age Verification

The federal minimum age for the sale of tobacco products in the US is 21 years, as per the Tobacco 21 law. However, states may have additional restrictions on youth access to tobacco products, including stricter age verification protocols. The Public Health Law Center provides a comprehensive review of these regulations in all 50 states. For more information on age verification laws and restrictions, visit the [Public Health Law Center's website](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/us-e-cigarette-regulations-50-state-review/states-laws-restricting-youth-access-e-cigarettes).

## Marketing Restrictions

Marketing of tobacco products in the US is subject to both federal and state laws. These regulations cover a wide range of areas, including advertising, product packaging, and sponsorship of events. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in significant penalties. For more information on marketing regulations, visit the [FDA's website](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/advertising-and-promotion) and the [Public Health Law Center's website](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/us-e-cigarette-regulations-50-state-review).

## FDA Approval for Heated Tobacco Devices

The FDA has authorized the marketing of new tobacco products manufactured by Philip Morris Products S.A. for the IQOS “Tobacco Heating System”. This electronic device heats tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper to generate a nicotine-containing aerosol. The FDA has placed stringent marketing restrictions on the products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure.

The authorization process involved a rigorous science-based review through the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway. The agency determined that authorizing these products for the U.S. market is appropriate for the protection of the public health because, among several key considerations, the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes. The products authorized for sale include the IQOS device, Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks. 

It's important to note that while today’s action permits the tobacco products to be sold in the U.S., it does not mean these products are safe or “FDA approved.” All tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive and those who do not use tobacco products should continue not to. 

The FDA will continue to evaluate new available data regarding the products through postmarketing records and reports required in the marketing order. The company is required to report regularly to the FDA with information regarding the products on the market, including, but not limited to, ongoing and completed consumer research studies, advertising, marketing plans, sales data, information on current and new users, manufacturing changes and adverse experiences. The FDA may withdraw a marketing order if it, among other reasons, determines that the continued marketing of a product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health, such as if there is an uptake of the product by youth.

## State-Specific Regulations

The regulatory landscape for heated tobacco devices varies significantly from state to state. For instance, in California, the sale of flavored tobacco products is banned, while in Virginia, there are no such restrictions. 

In terms of taxation, states like New York and Connecticut have high tax rates on tobacco products, while states like Missouri and Virginia have relatively low rates. It's important to note that these rates can change, and it's recommended to consult with a tax expert or legal professional for the most accurate information.

## Conclusion

Entering the US market as a seller of a heated tobacco device involves navigating a complex regulatory landscape. It is recommended to consult with legal professionals and industry experts to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations. The FDA's approval of the IQOS system is a significant development, but it's important to stay updated on regulatory changes at both the federal and state level.
